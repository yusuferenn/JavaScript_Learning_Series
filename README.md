# JavaScript_Learning_Series

This repository contains the projects I've created during my journey of learning JavaScript. My goal with these projects is to practice and enhance my JavaScript skills, advance my web development capabilities, and learn new topics through hands-on implementation.

## Projects

- [rgb-color-picker](./rgb-color-picker/): An application where users can adjust RGB color values using an interactive color picker.
- [weather-app](./weather-app/): A weather application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's location.

These projects focus on supporting learning through coding, gaining familiarity with web technologies, and addressing real-world problems. Each project has detailed explanations in its own folder.
