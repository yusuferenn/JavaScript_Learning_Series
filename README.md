This project is a simple website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## How It Works

1. First, you need to obtain an API key for the OpenWeatherMap API. You can get this key by signing up on the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) website.

2. Download the project files or clone this project as a Git repository.

3. Open the `index.js` file and replace the `key` variable with your API key.

4. Then, open the index.html file in a browser to see the weather information. Enter the name of the city you want to search in the input box on the website and click the "Search" button. 
The weather information will be displayed on the screen.

```javascript
const key = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
